# Senior-Project
 This is the Senior Project for Andrew Jelson. I worked on this project over the fall semester of 2020 amid the Covid-19 crisis.

 The main python file in the repository is the "Algorithms.py". In that file I compare and contrast the current widely used algorithms for triangulating meshes off of point clouds. The metrics are as follows:



 Another facet of this project is a Convolutional Neural Network that can be used to triangulate a mesh. Under the practice folder you can find a Neural Network that reads 3D  numerical point clouds and classifies them based on their number. "CNN.py" is a work in progress in creating a Neural Network that can read in .STL or .OBJ files, convert them to point clouds, and use the network to determine the triangulation. This project is still a work in progress and is currently not a final solution. 
 
 The remaining 2 folders are the STL files that are used in the project. Platonic Solids is a folder of small STL platonic solids for testing the data, and STLs is a small list of STL files that are far more complex and used in comparing the complexity of the data.

 This project is done in Python3 and uses the following libraries:
 OS
 Open3D
 Matplotlib
 Numpy
 Tensorflow
 Keras
 H5PY
 Pickle
 SciPy
